CSS3AmericanFlag
================

Any decent front-end vato has to have a CSS 3 American flag man!!!

If you ever go to a job interview and some douche bag asks you how many html elements does it take to make an American flag with pure CSS?  You can tell him: 1 element douche bag!

And the US flag has 50 STARS and 13 stripes.  If you're a white boy who claims to be an American and doesn't know that there's 50 stars and 13 stripes on the US flag then you're a stupid in-bred motherfucker.
