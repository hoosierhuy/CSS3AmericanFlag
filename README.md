CSS3AmericanFlag
================

Any decent front-end vato has to have a CSS 3 American flag man!!!

If you ever go to an interview and some dude asks you how many html elements does it take to make an American flag with pure CSS?  You can tell him: 1 element dude!  And I've proven it here. 

And the US flag has 50 STARS and 13 stripes.  I can't believe I actually had a debate with a fellow native born American regarding this subjec during an interview.
